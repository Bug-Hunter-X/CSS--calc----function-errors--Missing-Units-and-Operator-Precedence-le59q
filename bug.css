The CSS property `calc()` might produce unexpected results if used incorrectly with units. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because the unit is missing from the subtracted value.  Another common mistake is incorrect operator precedence.  Make sure to use parentheses correctly to ensure the calculation is performed as intended. For example, `margin: calc((100vw - 800px) / 2);` is more likely to be correct than `margin: calc(100vw - 800px / 2);`
